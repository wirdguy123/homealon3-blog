                <p class="text">My main goal with this website is to get better at javascript, so to achieve this I am going to make a little game at the bottom of this page, but as of wrighting this it has not been made yet</p>
                <p class="text">I am going to try to create a comment box so I can recieve feedback and project ideas.</p>
